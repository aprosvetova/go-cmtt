# Golang bindings for the Cmtt API

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/aprosvetova/go-cmtt?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/aprosvetova/go-cmtt)

I'm very new to Go, so I'll be happy if you make some Pull Requests and help me with tests.

Read the [Cmtt API docs](http://shir-man.com/static/tjapi/) to understand how it works.
